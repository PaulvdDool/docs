# Zed Docs
Welcome to the Zed Docs repository! 

Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. Our goal is to build the world's best text editor for developers and their teams.

We highly encourage contributions from the community to improve and expand the documentation.

## Contributing
Your contributions are invaluable to us, and we appreciate your interest in helping us improve the Zed documentation. Whether you want to fix typos, improve explanations, or add new content, every contribution is welcome. 

### Steps to contribute a change:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive and meaningful name
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request against `main`

## Structure
The docs are written in Markdown. Each file corresponds to a page in the documentation. The documentation is hosted on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and can be accessed at [docs.zed.dev](https://docs.zed.dev/general/readme). 

[`SUMMARY.md`](https://github.com/zed-industries/docs/blob/main/SUMMARY.md) defines the page structure.

### Previewing Changes

You can Githubâ€™s preview or a tool like [markdown live preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to preview your changes.

We will review your changes before merging them to ensure they look correct.

### GitBook Content Blocks and Assets
GitBook offers proprietary content blocks not expressed in plain Markdown. You can read more about [Gitbook Blocks](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-creation/blocks) on their site or by creating a free GitBook account and experimenting with your own repository. 

If you need to add images or other assets to the documentation, please add them to the .gitbook/assets directory and follow the best practices outlined in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/zed-industries/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Updating the Table of Contents
When adding a new file or proposing changes to the structure of the documentation, please edit the SUMMARY.md file, which serves as the table of contents for the documentation.
